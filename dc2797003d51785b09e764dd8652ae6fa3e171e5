@Zales0123 Hello! Is it possible to fix your conflict? This PR is great!

@pamil @lchrusciel I have a fully functional code for Symfony Mailer with another SenderAdapter. If we merge this PR, resolve conflict on #7 and add SymfonyMailerAdapter, this bundle/component will works very well until his deprecation.

Do we still need a twig as a dependency on this library then?
